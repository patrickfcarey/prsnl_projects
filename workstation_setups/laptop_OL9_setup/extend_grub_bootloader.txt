To extend the time the GRUB bootloader waits before booting the default OS on Oracle Linux 9, you can increase the GRUB timeout. Here's how to do it:

ðŸ›  Steps to Change GRUB Timeout:
Open a terminal (youâ€™ll need superuser privileges):

sudo nano /etc/default/grub
Find this line in the file:

GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
Change the value to however many seconds you want (e.g., 15):

GRUB_TIMEOUT=15
Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+O, then Enter, then Ctrl+X).

Regenerate the GRUB configuration:

For BIOS systems:

sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
For UEFI systems:

sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg
Oracle Linux uses the redhat directory for GRUB by default in UEFI.

Reboot to test:

sudo reboot
âœ… Optional: Confirm UEFI or BIOS
To check whether you're using UEFI or BIOS:

[ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && echo "UEFI mode" || echo "Legacy BIOS mode"
Let me know if you're dual-booting or using a custom bootloader layout, as the location of the GRUB config might vary slightly.
