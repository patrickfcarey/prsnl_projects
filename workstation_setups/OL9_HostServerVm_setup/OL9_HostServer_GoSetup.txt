Here's a step-by-step guide to install Go (Golang) on your Oracle Linux system:
1. Check Your System
Ensure your Oracle Linux installation is up to date. Open a terminal and run:
bash
    sudo yum update -y

2. Download the Latest Go Version
Visit the official Go website (https://go.dev/dl/) to find the latest stable version. As of March 26, 2025, you can download it directly via the terminal. For example, if the latest version is 1.22.1 (check the site for the current version), use:
bash
    wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz	
Adjust the version number if a newer one is available.

3. Extract the Archive
Once downloaded, extract the tarball to /usr/local:
bash
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz	
This places the Go binary in /usr/local/go.

4. Set Up Environment Variables
You need to add Go to your system’s PATH so you can run it from anywhere. Edit your shell profile file (e.g., ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc):
bash
    nano ~/.bash_profile
Add the following lines:
bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano) and apply the changes:
bash
    source ~/.bash_profile

5. Verify Installation
Check that Go is installed correctly by running:

bash
    go version
You should see output like:
go version go1.24.1.linux-amd64

6. Optional: Test with a Simple Program
Create a test file:

bash
    mkdir -p ~/go/src/hello
    nano ~/go/src/hello/hello.go

Add this code:
    go
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
    }
Save and run it:

bash
    go run ~/go/src/hello/hello.go
You should see:
Hello, Go!

Troubleshooting
If yum doesn’t work, ensure your Oracle Linux repositories are configured correctly (sudo yum repolist).
For 32-bit systems, download the linux-386 tarball instead of linux-amd64.
If you encounter permission issues, use sudo or check directory ownership.
That’s it! You now have Go installed on your Oracle Linux system. Let me know if you run into any issues!
