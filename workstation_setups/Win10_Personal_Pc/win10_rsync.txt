Setup wsl

powershell 
$ wsl --install

update computer as necessary, when in Ubuntu run these commands to update, upgrade, install rsync

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install rsync

create directory in wsl for network drive (assumes you already have bound Drive to Z:)

$ sudo mkdir /mnt/z
$ sudo mount -t drvfs Z: /mnt/z

run rsync commands (maybe create .sh utility to run next time)
$ rsync -varP source target
$ rsync -varP /mnt/z/root/media_2x/vms /mnt/m/root/media_2x/
